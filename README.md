## Ernie Ball Earthwood Acoustic Guitar Strings â€” Medium Light and Medium

I don't have a lot of experience with steel-string flattop guitars, or the strings that go on them. I've had a Yamaha dreadnought with a solid spruce top for maybe seven or so years now. It hasn't gotten a whole lot of playing time, and I probably kept the factory strings on it for three years.

It's was the $200 model that Guitar Center sells (or sold), the FG-403S (??). I got it because I wanted a guitar I could throw in my trunk and not worry about. But although it was VERY solidly built and extremely well-finished (except for some excess glue on the bracing inside the box), I can't bring myself to treat it badly.

So the Yamaha is an "indoor" guitar that doesn't live in a car trunk. Since I've had the guitar, I also bought a smaller car with a hatchback and no "real" trunk anyway. Plus it's COVID quarantine, so it's not like I'm going to work or anything like that.

The guitar shipped with whatever strings Yamaha puts on at the factory, which seemed to be phosphor bronze starting about .012 gauge for the high E.
